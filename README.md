## Project Insight 
The Sales Insight Dashboard transforms raw retail transaction data into an interactive and visually rich report. It combines multiple views to provide a 360-degree understanding of business performance. Line and bar charts track daily and yearly order trends, helping to identify seasonal patterns and peak demand periods. Donut and stacked bar visuals display order distribution by product category, city, shipping mode, discount, profit margin, and cost price, making it easy to spot high-performing products, profitable customer segments, and logistics bottlenecks. Together these insights enable stakeholders to monitor key KPIs, optimize pricing and discounts, improve inventory planning, and make data-driven decisions for better sales performance.
